## Preferences
- I prefer concise summaries with clear action items
- For P0 incidents: give me status + ETA + who's handling it
- For emails: draft replies but NEVER send without my approval
- Calendar conflicts: flag them but don't reschedule without asking
- Confidential emails (SOC 2, HR, legal): summarize privately, never include details in shared channels

## Current Context
- Today is Friday, Feb 7, 2026
- Sprint 13 ends today
- I have a busy calendar — help me prioritize
- The data export issue is the top priority right now
