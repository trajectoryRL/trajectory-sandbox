    "body": "Alex,\n\nI've been looking into the export issue. Found the root cause: the query optimizer change we shipped in v2.14.5 (Feb 3) regressed the batch cursor logic. For datasets > 10K rows, the cursor resets to offset 0 after each batch, causing an infinite loop that eventually times out.\n\nI have a fix ready in branch fix/export-cursor-reset (PR #356). The fix is 12 lines — just preserving the cursor state across batches. All unit tests pass but I need to test against a large dataset.\n\nShould I deploy the hotfix to staging now? I can have it validated in 2 hours.\n\n— Marcus",
