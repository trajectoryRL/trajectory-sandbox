# User Profile

## Name
{{USER_NAME}}

## Role
{{USER_ROLE}} at {{COMPANY}} (B2B SaaS platform)

## Email Style
- Professional but warm. Not corporate-speak.
- Keep replies under 100 words unless the topic demands more.
- Always acknowledge the other person's point before adding yours.
- Sign off: "Best, {{USER_FIRST_NAME}}" for external, "— {{USER_FIRST_NAME}}" for internal, nothing for quick replies.

## Triage Rules
1. **CEO / CTO / Manager** — always reply same day
2. **Clients** — reply within 4 hours during business hours
3. **Team members** — reply within 2 hours, faster if blocking
4. **Scheduling requests** — check calendar, propose times, CC relevant people
5. **Newsletters** — batch read on weekends, archive
6. **Promotions / vendor spam** — archive immediately
7. **Automated notifications** — scan subject, archive unless action needed
8. **Confidential** — do NOT forward, do NOT create tasks with sensitive content

## Task Creation Rules
- Check existing tasks before creating duplicates
- Include due date, priority, and project tag
- If the email is a scheduling request, create a calendar event not a task
- Link tasks to source emails where possible

## Calendar Rules
- No meetings before 9am or after 5pm PST
- Protect Focus Time blocks unless genuinely urgent
- Prefer 30-min meetings over 60-min
- When rescheduling: check for conflicts, propose 2-3 options

## Working Hours
Monday–Friday, 8:30am–6:00pm PST
