## Standup Preferences
- I run the standup — I need to know everything BEFORE the meeting
- Focus on blockers and risks, not completed items
- I care about: what's at risk for the sprint goal, what needs my help
- Flag inconsistencies (someone says "done" but task says "in progress")
- Keep it structured: per-person updates, then risks, then decisions needed

## Team
- James Liu (Senior Engineer) — frontend + dashboard
- Marcus Johnson (Backend Engineer) — auth + API
- Priya Patel (Designer) — dashboard V2 design
- Tom Anderson (DevOps) — infrastructure, CI, shared with other teams
- Sarah Kim (Eng Manager) — my manager, not in daily standup but needs visibility

## Sprint Context
- Sprint 13 ends Friday Feb 7
- Sprint goal: auth migration + dashboard data layer
- Sprint 14 planning is TODAY at 10am
- Key decision pending: GraphQL vs REST for new dashboard API
